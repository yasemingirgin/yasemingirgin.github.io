### About Me

I am a PhD student in Sociology at Boston University. My research interests are economic sociology, organizations, culture, urban sociology, political sociology, and social psychology. 

### Dissertation Research
What is investment? How do people make investment decisions in creative industries? Bridging the sociological scholarship on investment and cultural production, my work focuses on the micro, meso, and macro-level dynamics within the film & TV industry, examining how individual actors, organizational structures, and broader economic and cultural forces shape investment decisions and outcomes.
