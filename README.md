### About Me

I am a PhD candidate in Sociology at Boston University. My research areas are economic sociology, organizations, culture, urban sociology, political sociology, and social psychology. 

### Dissertation Research
How does identity shape market competition in creative industries? My dissertation analyzes the film and television industry in Turkey across micro, meso, and macro levels, examining how culture, identity, and market structures influence investment strategies and outcomes in a field where symbolic value and competition intersect.
